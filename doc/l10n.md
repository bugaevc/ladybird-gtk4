# Translating Ladybird
## gettext
Ladybird is translated with the help of [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/).

Add a new translation:

### 1. Add a new po file

You can find current translations in the [`po` directory](po/), copy one of the files and translate all the strings in `msgstr`.

Alternatively, if you're building on the host (this may or may not work for the Flatpak builds), you can create a mostly-empty `.po` file, register it with CMake as described below, and run the build once. The build system should automatically populate the `.po` file with the strings to translate.

You also have to change some meta information:
```
# Swedish translation for Ladybird.
"Language: sv\n"
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=n != 1;\n"
```
Read more about [Plural-Forms](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Plural-forms.html)

### 2. CMakeLists.txt

Add your `.po` file to the `linguas` list in [po/CMakeLists.txt](po/CMakeLists.txt)
```
set(linguas
    eo.po
    ru.po
    sv.po
)
```
### 3. org.serenityos.Ladybird-gtk4.desktop
Translate the strings in [org.serenityos.Ladybird-gtk4.desktop](org.serenityos.Ladybird-gtk4.desktop). Read more in [Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#localized-keys)

```
GenericName[sv]=Webbläsare
Name[sv]=Nytt fönster
Name[sv]=Nytt privat fönster
```

## Translating Adwaita components

Some components in Ladybird, like `Tab Overview` ([TabOverview](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.TabOverview.html)) and `About Ladybird` ([AboutWindow](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/main/class.AboutWindow.html)) uses components from [libadwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita). These might or might not already have a translation, you can find these in [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita/-/tree/main/po](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita/-/tree/main/po).


## Resources for translating

GNOME Wiki might have information about localization & translating your language, give `https://wiki.gnome.org/{Language name in English}` a look. (For example, https://wiki.gnome.org/Esperanto, https://wiki.gnome.org/Swedish).

If libadwaita is already translated to your language then feel free to reuse terms and words for consistency with Adwaita/GNOME.

When in doubt, it's also a good idea to look at how the similar component / string is translated in [GNOME Web](https://github.com/GNOME/epiphany/tree/master/po). We don't have to follow GNOME Web 100%, but it's also a very handy resource for design & translation ideas.
